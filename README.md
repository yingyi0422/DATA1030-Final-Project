This is the final project for Brown DSI DATA1030.

Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the London Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project. The goal is to predict the demand for bike sharing in London based on several factors including weather conditions, time of the year, and more. This project uses machine learning models to understand the patterns in bike sharing usage and predict future demand.

System Requirements
Python Version: Python 3.8+
Packages / Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, shap
